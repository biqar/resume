Work Experience

2012-2015

    _Software Engineer and Manager/Tech Lead for WibiData, Inc_ (San
    Francisco).

    As the fourth employee at a Big Data startup, I helped grow the
    company from six people to over forty, surviving one name change and
    three changes of logos. Technical responsibilities revolved around
    the development of a personalization platform and applications on
    top of Hadoop, HBase, and Cassandra.

    I was the project/tech lead on the effort to open source our
    technology, responsible for breaking down the large effort into
    manageable, prioritized tasks for the entire team. This was the
    beginning of the Kiji Project. I also was the tech lead on our
    earliest real time scoring component, Kiji Scoring

    As we grew, I transitioned to a dual technical-managerial role,
    managing ten direct reports (maximum of five at one time).

    Tech Lead/Manager of the platform team, responsible for the lowest
    level core technologies in WibiData’s architecture as well as our
    internal build tools and scripts.

2011 (3 months)

    _Software Engineer at Panasas_ (Pittsburgh, PA).

    Internship after leaving grad school. Relevant project work was the
    instrumentation of a FreeBSD kernel driver to implement QoS in
    network attached storage devices of a parallel, distributed
    filesystem.


Technologies and Skills

Python
    Most recent technological work has been in Python. Author of
    devtools and small build components, e.g. packrat.

Java
    Experienced with Java for distributed applications and Map Reduce
    programs. I’ve also used Scala but am less familiar with it.

Hadoop Stack
    I’ve used a variety of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem:
    MapReduce, Yarn, HBase, Hive, Scaldng, etc. This space is always
    moving and I’ve had to port our ecosystem to different versions of
    the Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop and others, dealing with the
    bugs and changes along the way.

SCRUM and hygienic coding
    One of the first scrum masters at WibiData. Led Sprint Planning for
    platform team. Experienced in a culture of culture of code reviews,
    code style guides, etc. Owned the effort on crafting our Python
    style guide.
