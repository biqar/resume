Work Experience
---------------

2012-2015
:   *Software Engineer and Manager/Tech Lead for [WibiData, Inc](https://www.wibidata.com)* (San Francisco).
    
    Fourth employee at a Big Data startup that grew to over forty, surviving
    one name change and three changes to the logo. Technical work was the
    development of a platform for personalized applications on top of Hadoop,
    HBase, and Cassandra.
    
    I was the project/tech lead on the effort to open source our software stack,
    responsible for breaking down the entire effort into manageable,
    prioritized tasks for the team. This was the beginning of the
    [Kiji Project](https://github.com/kijiproject). Later, I also was the tech
    lead on our earliest real time scoring component,
    [Kiji Scoring](https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-scoring)
    
    As we grew, I transitioned to a dual technical-managerial role, managing
    ten direct reports during my tenure (a maximum of five at one time).
    
    My last position was Tech Lead/Manager of the platform team, responsible
    for the lowest level core technologies in WibiData's architecture as well
    as our internal build tools and scripts.

2011 (3 months)
:   *Software Engineer at [Panasas](http://www.panasas.com/)* (Pittsburgh, PA).

    Internship after leaving grad school. Relevant project work was the
    instrumentation of a FreeBSD kernel driver to implement QoS I/O scheduling
    in network attached storage devices for our parallel, distributed
    filesystem.
    
Technologies and Skills
-----------------------
Python
:   Most of my recent technological work has been in Python. Author of devtools
    and small build components, e.g.
    [packrat](https://github.com/sqrl/packrat).

Java
:   Experienced coding distributed applications and map-reduce programs in
    Java. I've also used Scala but am less familiar with it.

Hadoop Stack
:   I've used a variety of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem for model
    training and analytics: MapReduce, Yarn, HBase, Hive, Scaldng, etc. This space is always moving and I've had to port our ecosystem to different versions of the Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop and others, dealing with the bugs and changes along the way.

SCRUM and hygienic coding
:   I was one of the first scrum masters at WibiData. Led Sprint Planning for
    platform team. Experienced in a culture of culture of code reviews, code
    style guides, etc. Owned the effort on writing our Python style guide.
