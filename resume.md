    * Fourth employee at a Big Data startup that grew to over forty.
    * Survived one name change and three changes to the logo.
    * Developed a platform for personalized applications on top of Hadoop,
    HBase, and Cassandra.
        * Our platform was used in production to deliver real-time
    product recommendations at two large retail customers, including holiday
    traffic.
    
    * Project/tech lead on the effort to open source our software stack as the
    [Kiji Project](https://github.com/kijiproject).
        * Broke down the effort into manageable, prioritized tasks for the team,
        delivering tested, first releases on schedule.
        * Kiji permitted us to better engage with our community with our own
        meet-ups, etc.
        * Tech lead on our earliest real time scoring component,
    [Kiji Scoring](https://github.com/kijiproject/kiji-scoring) that served our
        first real time recommendations.
    
    * Transitioned to a dual technical-managerial role and managed
    ten direct reports during my tenure (a maximum of five at one time).
    
    * Tech Lead/Manager of the platform team.
        * Responsible for the foundational layers of our stack.
        * Developed and help design internal build tools and scripts that
        reduced compile time and improved engineer productivity.

2011 (3 months)
:   *Software Engineer internship at [Panasas](http://www.panasas.com/)* (Pittsburgh, PA).

    * Project work towards instrumenting a FreeBSD kernel driver to implement
    QoS I/O scheduling in network attached storage devices for our parallel,
    distributed filesystem.
        
Technologies and Skills
-----------------------
Python
:   My most recent projects have been in Python.

    * Authored devtools and simple but helpful build components, e.g.
    [packrat](https://github.com/sqrl/packrat) which we used internally at WibiData to cache and share build artifacts.

Java
:   Experienced coding distributed applications and map-reduce programs in
    Java. I've also used Scala but am less familiar with it.
  
Hadoop Stack
:   I've used a variety of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem for model
    training and analytics: MapReduce, Yarn, HBase, Hive, Scalding, etc.
    
    * Ported our ecosystem to different versions of the Cloudera Distribution 
    of Hadoop and others, dealing with the bugs and changes along the way.
    * Debugged numerous grungy issues in HBase ecosystem, such as ZooKeeper
    references, unblocking coworkers.

SCRUM and hygienic coding
:   I was one of the first scrum masters at WibiData. Everyone does it differently.

    * Led Sprint Planning for platform team, working with Product to prioritize
    tasks.
    * Experienced in a culture of culture of code reviews, code
    style guides, etc.
    * Owned the effort on writing our Python style guide.
